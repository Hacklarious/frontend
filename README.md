Absolutely useless virtual pet. Interact with it, play with it.. it will never die (or will it? try feeding it 3x).

## Quick overview
This is a purely frontend project built with React. It interacts with a RESTful API to retrieve jokes, the alarm list and set a new alarm.

The project is deployed to Google Cloud Storage and can be accessed in our [very-unique domain](http://very-unique-domain-name.tech). Domain registered with [Domain.com](https://www.domain.com/). Internally the frontend uses Axios for making HTTP calls, Semantic UI for basic user-interface building blocks, moment.js for handling dates, and Animate.css and Framer for animations.

Our RESTful API stores the information in a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) database.


## Features

## Technologies used
General:
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [Create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev)
- [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org)
- [Semantic UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com)

## Google Cloud Usage
- Static deployments to Google Cloud Storage
- Cloud Storage configuration via Cloud Shell (setting CORS, setting default index page)
- Uptime monitoring with uptime checks
- Email alerts for uptime check (what if our pet goes down?!)
- Cloud Storage monitoring dashboard
- [Cloud Function](https://github.com/Hacklarious/cloud-function-should-i-run) for checking if an alarm clock should be showed or not (poll every 10 seconds)
- Firebase for storing various customer interaction events (yes, we know Firebase is not meant to be used for such things.. it's a ridiculous approach; and that's the goal of it)
